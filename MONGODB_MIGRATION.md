# MongoDB Migration for NoteMind

This document describes the changes made to migrate NoteMind from using in-memory data storage to MongoDB.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Created `config/db.js` to handle MongoDB connection
   - Added database connection to `server.js`

2. **Models**
   - Used existing Mongoose models in `models/User.js` and `models/Note.js`
   - Added text indexing for search functionality

3. **Authentication**
   - Updated `authController.js` to use MongoDB instead of in-memory arrays
   - Leveraged Mongoose models' methods for password hashing and token generation
   - Improved error handling with specific MongoDB error messages

4. **Note Management**
   - Updated `noteController.js` to use MongoDB operations instead of array manipulation
   - Added proper MongoDB queries for filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Fixed ObjectId handling for user references

5. **Authorization Middleware**
   - Updated `auth.js` middleware to validate tokens against MongoDB users
   - Added proper user authentication checks using Mongoose

## Using the Application

The application should now work exactly as before, but with data stored persistently in MongoDB. The MongoDB connection string is stored in the `.env` file.

## Data Migration

There is no specific data migration process as the application was previously using in-memory storage only. New data will be saved to MongoDB going forward.

## Benefits of MongoDB Integration

- **Data Persistence**: Data is now stored permanently across server restarts
- **Scalability**: MongoDB can handle large amounts of data and users
- **Query Performance**: Using MongoDB's indexing for faster search
- **Data Relationships**: Properly modeled relationships between users and notes
- **Security**: Improved authentication and authorization
